# SMSecret

This project encompasses an Android App and a Web App. The objective was for the user to filter and encrypt SMSs from certain phone numbers or messages with certain contents, hiding the notifications, and only being able to decrypt them by providing the password. The Web App allows the user to send and receive SMSs using the web browser, securely, by reading a QR code with the Android App, which creates a temporary session between both.
